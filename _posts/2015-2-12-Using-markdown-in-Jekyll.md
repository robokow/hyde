title: Using markdown language in Jekyll
tags: [Jekyll]

*Markup language* is not new to me. I usually type in plain html but just now I learned I can also use *markdown* language for editing posts in Jekyll, which makes editing and writing text a lot cleaner. So let's make life easier with this new markdown that Jekyll supports.

I use a form of markdown on Github as well. But it took quite a while to get my head around it. In fact I was like: wait again another way of editing stuff. I use the wiki syntax quite a lot, and html and in the old days other markup-languages, do I have to learn yet another way of writing down stuff*???*

So yeah I am rather lazy; I just do stuff first and only if things break I read the manual (oh sh*). Or I find another way of doing things, only later to return to the same problem that's still waiting to be solved. Maybe then, but only then I start reading the manual.

##Testing markdown
But with time comes maturity and patience to actually read manuals. Hence I find myself reading a manual now about markdown and need some testing. That's why this post, which itself is written with markup, following [this manual](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). And hey, what does this make life easy! 

One of the first things that takes my mind apart is this markup/ markdown language stems from 2004! That's eleven years and I am just picking up on it now. Wtf.

###Blockquotes
I like to use blockquotes a lot in my writings. It's good way to source to other person's writing, especially when things are said i a much better way than you could think of. And to use Blockquotes in Markup is really easy.
>Markdown allows you to be lazy and only put the > before the first line of a hard-wrapped paragraph

And it evens has the possibility to place a quote inside a quote. Not that I have ever done that, but it's good to know it can be done. All of this really saves me a lot of hassle of wrapping blockquotes around text. Or even worse: selecting text and clicking with mousebuttons.

###Lists
A great way to offer content is by using lists. 

* Lists are great
* In Markdown this is easy 
* In Html as well but ...  

The thing to remind myself is to give a blank space between the paragraph separating the list with the text, or else * the list will * not come.

##Markdown manuals
There is many great manuals out there.

* <http://sourceforge.net/p/jekyllc/bugs/markdown_syntax>
* <http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax>
* <https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/>

**Action**: I will be going through those manuals a lot more now and will force myself to write only in markdown from now on.
