title: Using markup language in Jekyll
---

*Markup language* is new to me. I just started typing these pages plain and straight in html but just now I learned I can also use markdown language for that. So let's make my life somewhat easier with markup.

I use it at Github as well from time to time. But it took a while to get my head around. In fact I was like: wait again another way of editing stuff. I use the wiki syntax quite a lot, and html and in the old days other markup-languages, do I have to learn yet another way of writing down stuff?

So yeah I am rather lazy and more te type of person trying to do stuff first before reading manuals. If things than don't work I just find another way of doing stuff, only later to return to the same problem waiting to be solved. Maybe then I start reading the manual.

##Testing markup
But with time comes maturity and patience to actually read manuals. Hence I find myself reading a manual now about markup language and need some testing. That's why this post, which itself is written with markup, following [this manual](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). And hey, what does this make life easy! 

One of the first things that takes my mind apart is this markup language stems from 2004! That's eleven years ago and I am just picking up on it now. Wtf.

###Blockquotes
I like to use blockquotes a lot in my writings. It's good way to source to other person's writing, especially when things are said i a much better way than you could think of. And to use Blockquotes in Markup is really easy.
>Markdown allows you to be lazy and only put the > before the first line of a hard-wrapped paragraph

And it evens has the possibility to place a quote inside a quote. Not that I have ever done that, but it's good to know it can be done
>Blockquotes can be nested by adding additional levels of >:
>>(i.e. a blockquote-in-a-blockquote) 

This really saves me a lot of hassle of wrapping blockquotes around text. Or even worse: selecting text and clicking with mousebuttons.

###Lists
A great way to offer content is by using lists. 

* Lists are great
* In Markup this is easy 
* In Html as well but ...  

The thing to remind myself is to give a blank space between the paragraph separating the list with the text, or else * the list will * not come.

##Markup manuals
There is many great manuals out there.

* <http://sourceforge.net/p/jekyllc/bugs/markdown_syntax>
* <http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax>
* <https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/>

**Action**: I will be going through those manuals a lot more now and will force myself to write only in markdown from now on.
