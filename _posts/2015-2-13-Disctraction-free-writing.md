Writing freely means you just let go, let it flow and let those words come. Lose your inner censor and let those words appear as they come. To do so it's essential to have a clean interface that helps you to write freely. To give you some focus.

To write is something else then to read. While writing words and sentences find their shape, but while reading my stuff when it's done, I need see my stuff differently. I must see it published, either on paper or on web. But it must be on an interface that is different than my writing interface.

Here comes my love for Jekyll and other static website generators. I type my stories in my favourite editor - a local and minimalistic text-editor - I save those docs and I can instantly see the post in my webbrowser! Nothing beats that.

This is just totally what I've always wanted. It's a perfect generator to build simple and even complex websites while being able to just write. I can finally really focus on content.
