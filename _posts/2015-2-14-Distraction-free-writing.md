Writing freely means you just let go, let it flow and don't hesitate. Lose your inner censor and let those words appear as they come. To do so it's essential to have a clean interface that helps you to write freely. To give you some focus.

To write is something else then to read. While writing, words and sentences find their shape. But when editing, I need see the result in a different format. I must see it in a  published way, either on paper or on web. But to edit well I must see the text on an interface that is different than my writing interface.

Here comes my love for Jekyll and other static website generators. I type my stories in my favourite editor - a local and minimalistic text-editor - I save those docs and I can instantly see the post in my webbrowser! Nothing beats that. It's a perfect way to build simple and even complex websites while being able to just write. I can finally really focus on content.
