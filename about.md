This about page was written from the command line, and pushed to the server in such as easy way that my mind got blown away. I am not a coder. I just like to use Linux since a fairly long time (my first installation was in 2003) and I love simplicity. But I am a github user and I like the community.

### More Information

I am not sure how long I will be gone before my legs will hit the ground. I am landing slowly. Learning and gasping.

### Contact me
