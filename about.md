This about page was written from the command line, and pushed to the server in such as easy way that my mind got blown away. I am not a coder. I just like to use Linux since a fairly long time (my first install was in 2003) and I *love* the command line. 

I am also a Github user. I like community. Professionally I am an online publisher. I know about marketing. I know a fair bit of css and html. I can read a bit of code and speak the language. But generally I don't have such a great mathematical mind. I am a social geek rather. And a postconceptualist. Doing comes first. The beauty is the act itself. Only then the concept takes over.

### More Information

I am not sure how long I will be gone before my legs will hit the ground. I am landing slowly. Learning and gasping. 

Contact me if you must. See also my <a href="https://robokow.net/about">personal blog</a> if you want to know more about me.
